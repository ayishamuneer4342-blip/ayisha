            answer: "No, but it changes it. SEO is moving from 'finding links' to 'generating answers'. Brands must optimize for AI models (LLMs) by becoming the authoritative source of truth in their niche."

            answer: "Keywords still matter, but 'Topical Authority' matters more. Google wants to see that you cover a topic exhaustively, not just stuff keywords into a single page."

                If you are still doing SEO like it's 2023, you are already invisible. The introduction of Google's <strong>Search Generative Experience (SGE)</strong> and the rise of AI-driven answer engines have fundamentally rewritten the rules of organic search. In 2025, it's not about being found; it's about being <em>cited</em>.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                For brands in Dubai and beyond, the goal posts have moved. Here are the essential strategies you need to implement immediately to secure your digital real estate.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-deepBlue-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. Surviving the "Search Generative Experience" (SGE)</h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                Google now often provides a complete, AI-generated answer at the top of the results page, pushing traditional organic links further down. This means "Position 1" is no longer the top spot.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                <strong>The Strategy:</strong> You must optimize for <em>information gain</em>. If your content just repeats what everyone else says, the AI will ignore you. You need to provide unique data, original research, or contrarian viewpoints that the AI cites as a source.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-deepBlue-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Double Down on E-E-A-T</h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) is the filter through which all content is judged. In an era of AI-generated spam, "Experience" is the differentiator.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-slate-600 text-lg space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Show, Don't Just Tell:</strong> Don't just write "how to fix a sink." Show a video of <em>you</em> fixing the sink.</li>
                <li><strong>Author Bios:</strong> Ensure every blog post is attributed to a real expert with verifiable credentials linked to their LinkedIn or other authoritative profiles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-deepBlue-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Video is the New Text</h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                YouTube is the world's second-largest search engine. TikTok is the search engine of choice for Gen Z. If your brand doesn't have a video strategy, you are missing 40% of the search market.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                <strong>Action Item:</strong> Repurpose every high-performing blog post into a YouTube video and a series of YouTube Shorts/TikToks. Properly tag them to dominate video search results.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-deepBlue-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Optimization for "Zero-Click" Searches</h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                More than 60% of searches now end without a click. The user gets their answer from the results page itself.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                Provide concise, structured answers (schema markup) to common questions. While this might lower click-through rate, it builds massive brand authority and trust, which leads to conversions down the line.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-deepBlue-900 mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-slate-600 text-lg leading-loose">
                SEO in 2025 is harder, but the rewards are higher for those who adapt. It requires a shift from "gaming the algorithm" to "serving the user" with undeniable quality and authority.
            </p>
